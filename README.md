# Adversarial Box - Pytorch Adversarial Attack and Training

## Motivation?
[CleverHans](https://github.com/tensorflow/cleverhans) greatly facilitates code written in Tensorflow. However, PyTorch does not have the luck at this moment. [Foolbox](https://github.com/bethgelab/foolbox) supports multiple deep learning frameworks, but it lacks many major implementations (e.g., black-box attack, Carlini-Wagner attack, adversarial training). We feel this is a need to write a easy-to-use and versatile library to help our fellow researchers and engineers.
